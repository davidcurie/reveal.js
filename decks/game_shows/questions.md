3. In 2012, the Australian Broadcasting Company had to remove one of the
   episodes of 'Peppa Pig' from its library because of one of the show's
   characters. However, the show continues to run in the US. What was the
   problem?

    - It involved Peppa Pig
    - It involved something that can be found around the house
    - It is a safety concern unique to Australia

    It showed Peppa being friendly with a spider

4. In some french villages, it is common to call upon the services of a
   'Quatorzieme' at a dinner party or restaurant meal. Though likely unknown to
   the group, it's thought to be preferable to feed a stranger than leave it to
   luck. Why?

    - It was carried over from a Gallic superstition
    - It stems from Judas at the Last Supper
    - 'Quatorzieme' means 14th in French

    They are the 14th person, to avoid 13 at the table

5. In the 1910's, Brooklyn had streetcar trams on the city's roads, which
   proved to be an occupational hazard for pedestrians and the city. It was
   such a feature of the city that they named a sports team after those
   pedestrians. And though the team moved to the West Coast, they retained
   their nickname. Which team?

   - It's a baseball team
   - It's a member of the National League
   - They won the 2020 World Series

   The Los Angeles Dodgers

6. London's Millennium Concert and the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana
   are just two of the major events that have required the laying of cables
   over long distances through tiny underground tunnels. The engineers didn't
   have poles that could push the wires through these long, twisty tunnels.
   What did they do instead?

   - Airplane mechanics also do this
   - The solution does not involve human power
   - It requires weeks of preparation before this method can be used

   They tied threads onto ferrets
